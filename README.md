# Node-Tutes
Node.js tutorials, APIs, and other server-side stuff


I tried to break things up into a series of small bits- each focusing on a core feature of Node.js.

The general purpose here is to solidify my personal learning endeavors with practice. The end goal is to become proficient enough in Node to initialize, configure, and run a server for future projects. 

Each file has verbose comments describing what each thing does and why. Dependencies aren't included, but source files for the demos can be found in the containing folder(s).
