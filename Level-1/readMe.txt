Welcome to 'Level-1', which contains the most basic Node.js functions and how they're used. 

>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<

 They say the best way to learn something is to teach it, so I try to leave comments describing what each thing does as it happens (to the best of my current comprehension).

 So, the end-goal of Level-1 is to understand and be able to set up a server, configure it, and use it for future projects. Along the way, I'm hoping to get a good grip on:
  
    -Requests: Defining what happens for each status a user might encounter, and how to handle different types of requests. 
    -Responses: What to actually 'serve', whether it's plain text, a calculation, security check , or just routing to another app.
